## What is Terramate CLI?

Terramate CLI is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) code generation and orchestration tool for Terraform,
OpenTofu and Terragrunt. With Terramate, you can:

(a) **Simplify complex codebases** to make your work more productive and reliable. Break down large state files with
stacks to reduce run-time and blast radius and keep them DRY with native code generation.

(b) **Automate and orchestrate Terraform, OpenTofu and Terragrunt in any CI/CD** using Pull Request automation, GitOps
blueprints, and workflow tooling with zero-config orchestration and change detection.

(c) **Provide the foundation to later leverage Terramate Cloud**, a management layer that gives you visibility, control, and actionable insights into your infra.

## Installation

With brew:

```sh
brew install terramate
```

With Go:

```sh
go install github.com/terramate-io/terramate/cmd/...@latest
```

For other installation methods, please see the [documentation](https://terramate.io/docs/cli/installation).


## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started with Terramate is ourÂ [getting started guide](https://terramate.io/docs/cli/getting-started/).

## Why simplify complex codebases?

As Terraform and OpenTofu offer no standard pattern on how to organize code efficiently, projects quickly sprawl out of
control. The consequences are ***code complexity***, ***long-running pipelines***,
***large blast radius***, ***drift***, and ***poor governance***.

Terramate CLI enables a new approach to eliminating the root cause of these consequences: using a modular and efficient
approach called Terramate Stacks. A stack is a combination of infrastructure code, state and configuration, which can be
nested to split state further.

Organizationally, a stack is a way to establish an ownership model. By consistently sizing stacks into isolated units
that your team members can quickly understand, assuming ownership of your infra becomes a lot simpler.
Terramate CLI supports Terraform, OpenTofu and Terragrunt, and can be run locally as well as in your existing VCS
(Github, Gitlab) CI/CD.

Terramate CLI is designed to work especially well with [Terramate Cloud](https://cloud.terramate.io), which provides
an IaC management layer and offers a generous free tier. 

## Features

- **Orchestration:** Run any command and configurable workflows in stacks with unlimited concurrency.
- **Change Detection:** Only execute stacks that contain changes. Allows to detect changes in referenced Terraform and
OpenTofu modules as well as Terragrunt dependencies.
- **Code Generation:** Generate code such **HCL**, **JSON** and **YAML** to keep your stacks DRY (Don't repeat yourself). Comes with
support for global variables and functions.
- **Automation Blueprints:** Pre-configured GitOps workflows for GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket and Atlantis to enable Pull
Automation with plan previews in your existing CI/CD.
- **Drift Management:** Detect and reconcile drift with scheduled workflows.
- **Observability, Visibility and Insights:** Provides actionable insights and observability into your stacks, deployments,
and resources.


## Terramate Cloud

[Terramate Cloud](https://cloud.terramate.io?ref=github)Â provides you with the best IaC management experience possible. It helps you orchestrate your stacks
in your existing CI/CD platform, such as GitHub Actions, GitLab and Bitbucket Pipelines, so you don't need to buy yet
another CI/CD vendor.

It also provides a powerful dashboard that adds **observability** and **insights**, **deployment metrics**
(e.g., **DORA**), **notifications**, **drift management**, **asset management,** and more for your stacks to provide
the developer experience and infrastructure to build, scale and observe all your infrastructure managed with IaC.
