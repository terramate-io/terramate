# Command Line Interface (CLI)

The `terramate` tool has a rich command-line interface, supporting verbosity
levels, logging levels, multiple sub-commands (+experimental), autocompletion
and so on.

To view a list of available commands and global flags, execute `terramate --help`:

```
Usage: terramate <command>

A tool for managing terraform stacks

Flags:
  -h, --help                             Show context-sensitive help.
      --version                          Terramate version
  -C, --chdir=STRING                     Sets working directory
  -B, --git-change-base=STRING           Git base ref for computing changes
  -c, --changed                          Filter by changed infrastructure
      --tags=TAGS                        Filter stacks by tags. Use ":" for logical AND and "," for logical OR. Example: --tags app:prod filters
                                         stacks containing tag "app" AND "prod". If multiple --tags are provided, an OR expression is created.
                                         Example: "--tags A --tags B" is the same as "--tags A,B"
      --no-tags=NO-TAGS,...              Filter stacks that do not have the given tags
      --log-level="warn"                 Log level to use: 'disabled', 'trace', 'debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error', or 'fatal'
      --log-fmt="console"                Log format to use: 'console', 'text', or 'json'
      --log-destination="stderr"         Destination of log messages
      --quiet                            Disable output
  -v, --verbose=0                        Increase verboseness of output
      --disable-check-git-untracked      Disable git check for untracked files
      --disable-check-git-uncommitted    Disable git check for uncommitted files
      --disable-checkpoint               Disable checkpoint checks for updates
      --disable-checkpoint-signature     Disable checkpoint signature

Commands:
  version                          Terramate version
  create                           Creates a stack on the project
  fmt                              Format all files inside dir recursively
  list                             List stacks

  experimental clone               Clones a stack
  experimental trigger             Triggers a stack
  experimental metadata            Shows metadata available on the project
  experimental globals             List globals for all stacks
  experimental generate debug      Shows generate debug information
  experimental run-graph           Generate a graph of the execution order
  experimental run-order           Show the topological ordering of the stacks
  experimental run-env             List run environment variables for all stacks
  experimental vendor download     Downloads a Terraform module and stores it on the project vendor dir
  experimental eval                Eval expression
  experimental partial-eval        Partial evaluate the expressions
  experimental get-config-value    Get configuration value

Run "terramate <command> --help" for more information on a command.
```

All sub-commands support the `--help` flag as well for specific details.

Terramate supports autocompletion of commands for `bash`, `zsh` and `fish`. To
install the completion just run the command below and open a new shell session:

```bash
terramate install-completions
```

# CLI Configuration File

Terramate supports a per-user configuration file called `.terramaterc` (or
`terramate.rc` on Windows) which applies to all Terramate projects in the user's
machine by setting up default values for some CLI flags.

The configuration file is a simple HCL file containing top-level attributes.
The attribute expressions must only contain literal values (`number`, `string`,
etc) and no function calls.

Not all CLI flags can be configured by the configuration file.

Below is a list of options:

- `disable_checkpoint`

When set to `true`, disables [upgrade and security bulletin checks](./configuration/upgrade-check.md). This is similar to exporting the `DISABLE_CHECKPOINT=1` environment variable.

- `disable_checkpoint_signature`

 when set to `true`, still allows the [upgrade and security bulletin checks](./configuration/upgrade-check.md)
 described above but disables the use of an anonymous id used to de-duplicate warning messages.

## Location

The configuration should be placed in a different path depending on the operating
system:

On _Windows_, the file must be named `terraform.rc` and placed in the user's
`%APPDATA%` directory. The location of this directory depends on your _Windows_
version and system configuration. You can use the command below in _PowerShell_ to
find its location:

```PowerShell
$env:APPDATA
```

On Unix-based systems (_Linux_, _MacOS_, _*BSD_, etc), the file must be named
`.terraformrc` and placed in the home directory of the relevant user.

The default location of the Terramate CLI configuration file can also be specified
using the `TM_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.
Example:

```bash
TM_CLI_CONFIG_FILE=/etc/terramaterc terramate run -- <cmd>
```
