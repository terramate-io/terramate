# Synchronize Stacks

Stacks, Stack Metadata and Stack status, do not need to be synchronized regularly, as this data will be automatically synchronized during the following actions:

- Synchronize Previews (coming soon)
- [Synchronize Deployments](../deployments/)
- [Synchronize Drift Runs](../drifts/)
