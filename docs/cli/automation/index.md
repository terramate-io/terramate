# Running Terramate in Automation

One of the most important capabilities of Terramate is to leverage CI/CD platforms such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD,
BitBucket Pipelines, Azure DevOps, and others for cost-effective Terraform and OpenTofu automation and collaboration.

This enables you to automate the orchestration of your IaC stacks using GitOps workflows and comes with the following
benefits:

- **GitOps for infrastructure**: Move fast using a declarative, single source of truth with an auditable history and change management controls. Be more productive and reliable. Provide a better Developer Experience by building on top of tools your team already knows.
- **Run in any existing CI/CD**: Terramate helps you to achieve the best automation and collaboration experience when working with Terraform and OpenTofu in any CI/CD. This means you can reuse existing infrastructure, collaboration features, audit logs and security.
- **Design your workflows without limitations**: Configure limitless workflows. Whether you prefer merge-and-apply or apply-and-merge; we got you covered.
- **Integrate any existing tooling**: Integrate third-party toolings such as *Infracost*, *Trivy*, *terrascan*, *checkov*, *OPA*, *Kyverno*, *Sentinel* and others into your workflows. Terramate allows you to integrate and run any tool.
- **Reduce execution time of existing pipelines**: Parallel runs and change detection allows orchestrating stacks containing changes only and running those in parallel.
- **No extra budget needed**: Enable cost-effective automation for IaC by integrating with your existing CI/CD instead of paying
for an additional and expensive platform.
- **Maximum Security**: Using your existing CI/CD limits the number of privileged platforms in your organization. There's no need to provide an additional platform with access to your cloud accounts.
