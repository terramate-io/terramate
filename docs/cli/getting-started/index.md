---

# Quickstart

In this Quickstart guide, you will learn how to get started with [Terramate CLI](https://github.com/terramate-io/terramate)
from scratch by building a basic Terramate project that manages Terraform in stacks using the most essential Terramate
features, such as stacks, code generation, orchestration, and change detection.

<!-- NOTE: Add more tutorials over time -->
<!-- If you want to learn how to use Terramate in an existing Terraform project, go here instead: -->

If you want to get an overview of what Terramate CLI is and how it works, please read the [introduction guide](../introduction.md).

## Introduction

Terramate works best when used inside a git repository. This repository does not need to be remote or synchronized to
any VCS Platform such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket - a local repository is a great start to test things.

In this Quickstart Guide, we will do the following:

- Initialize a new git repository
- Create two stacks `first` and `second` and learn about Terramate's [Change Detection](../change-detection/index.md)
- Generate a Terraform Local Backend configuration in all stacks at once from a central place
- Create a plain Terraform Null Resource in the `second` stack
- Preview and apply the Null Resource using Terraform while leveraging [Change Detection](../change-detection/index.md)
and [Orchestration](../orchestration/index.md) features of Terramate.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tooling installed:

- A recent version of the `git` command line tool
  - Terramate assumes `main` to be the default branch. Any other branch can be set using the [`terramate.config.git.default_branch`](../projects/configuration.md) configuration option.
- A recent version of [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)
- Terramate CLI version [0.4.4](https://github.com/terramate-io/terramate/releases/) or above (for details on how to
install Terramate CLI, please see the [installation guide](../installation.md))

::: tip
You can also use [OpenTofu](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu) instead of
[Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) to complete this guide.
:::


### Create a new git repository

These steps initialize a new git repository, navigate into the new repository and
create an initial first commit. Terramate's [Change Detection](../change-detection/index.md) needs at least two commits
inside a repository to work: one commit to compare the changes to and another commit introducing changes.

As a first step, create a new git repository and navigate into it:

```sh
git init -b main terramate-quickstart
cd terramate-quickstart
```

Once you created the repository, create the first commit:

```sh
git commit --allow-empty -m 'Initial empty commit' 
```


## Create the first stack

Now that the repository is ready, we can create our first Terramate Stack. We will give the stack an optional `name` and
`description` at creation time. Name and description can be used to keep track of the purpose and details of a stack.
Terramate will ensure that on creation, each stack gets an `id` set automatically if not defined by the user.
This ID is a [`UUID`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) by default, guaranteeing the required
uniqueness within the repository. It is recommended to use UUIDs here, but it is optional.

The required argument defines a path to the stack that will be created. The path can be any directory with
any level of child directories.

```sh
terramate create \
  --name "A first stack" \
  --description "The very first Terramate Stack of the Quickstart guide" \
  stacks/first
```

The create command creates a file `stack.tm.hcl` containing a `stack {}` block to configure the stack, which should
look something like this.

```sh
cat stacks/first/stack.tm.hcl 
```

```sh
stack {
  name        = "A first stack"
  description = "The very first Terramate Stack of the Quickstart guide"
  id          = "935ff534-3c7c-4cbe-a156-691713bdfaec"
}
```

::: info
Stacks in Terramate are identified by a directory containing a `*.tm.hcl` file that contains a `stack {}` block.
The file can have any name but the [create](../cmdline/create.md) command always creates a file named `stack.tm.hcl`
:::

The new stack can be committed to the repository by running:

```sh
git add stacks/first/stack.tm.hcl
git commit -m 'Create the first terramate stack'
```

To verify that Terramate is aware of the new stack, we can run [`terramate list`](../cmdline/list.md).

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate list 
```

``` [output]
stacks/first
```
:::

## Create a second stack

To create a second stack, we follow the same commands.

```sh
terramate create \
  --name "A second stack" \
  --description "The second Terramate Stack of the Quickstart guide" \
  stacks/second

git add stacks/second/stack.tm.hcl
git commit -m 'Create a second terramate stack'
```

To verify that Terramate is aware of both stacks, we can run [`terramate list`](../cmdline/list.md) again.

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate list 
```

``` [output]
stacks/first
stacks/second
```
:::

## Change detection in action

As we created our stacks step by step and created a git commit per stack, we can leverage Terramate‚Äôs
[Change Detection](../change-detection/index.md) to see what changes we introduced in our latest commit.

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate list --changed 
```

``` [output]
stacks/second
```
:::

By running the command mentioned above, you will see only the second stack is listed now, as we newly introduced the
second stack without changing the first stack. Terramate‚Äôs [Change Detection](../change-detection/index.md) is based on a
[Git Integration](../change-detection/integrations/git.md) but also supports more integrations like
[Terraform](../change-detection/integrations/terraform.md) to detect affected stacks using a local Terraform Module
that has been updated outside of the stack.

## Code generation

Empty stacks are of not much use. One of Terramate‚Äôs primary use cases is orchestrating Terraform and generating code for
it - but Terramate is not limited to Terraform and can also be used with other tooling such as OpenTofu, Terragrunt,
Kubernetes, Helm, CloudFormation, etc.

Every Terraform stack will need a backend configuration. For the sake of this Quickstart Guide, we will use the
Terraform local backend.

To generate backend code we create a file called `stacks/backend.tm.hcl`:

```sh
cat <<EOF >stacks/backend.tm.hcl
generate_hcl "backend.tf" {
  content {
    terraform {
      backend "local" {}
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

This configuration tells Terramate to generate a `backend.tf` file in every stack it can reach within the `stacks/` directory.
In this case our `first` and `second` stack.

To trigger the code generation we need to run the [`generate`](../cmdline/generate.md) command:

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate generate
```

``` [output]
Code generation report

Successes:

- /stacks/first
	[+] backend.tf

- /stacks/second
	[+] backend.tf

Hint: '+', '~' and '-' mean the file was created, changed and deleted, respectively.
```
:::

The generation report will report any changes in the generated code. When run twice, no changes will be made.

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate generate
```

``` [output]
Nothing to do, generated code is up to date
```
:::

Let‚Äôs commit the changes and generated code:

```sh
git add stacks
git commit -m 'Add a Terraform Backend Config to all stacks'
```

::: tip
It's a recommended best practice to check in generated code to your repository.
For details, please see [code generation best practices](../code-generation/index.md#best-practices).
:::

## Run Terraform in both stacks

The stacks created in the previous sections both represent isolated Terraform environments. To make them functional,
we must run `terraform init` in both. This is where the Terramate Orchestration comes in handy, which allows us to
[run commands in stacks](../orchestration/run-commands-in-stacks.md) with the [run](../cmdline/run.md) command.
As mentioned before, Terramate is not limited to orchestrating Terraform but can run any command.

But before we can start, we need to prepare git to ignore terraform temporary files by adding a `.gitignore` file, which is
located in the root directory of our repository:

```sh
# NOTE: 
# You might not want to add state and lock file here
# This is just convenient when running the quickstart guide
cat <<EOF >.gitignore
.terraform
.terraform.lock.hcl
terraform.tfstate
EOF

git add .gitignore
git commit -m 'Add .gitignore'
```

Now let‚Äôs initialize Terraform in all stacks:

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate run terraform init
```

``` [output]
terramate: Entering stack in /stacks/first
terramate: Executing command "terraform init"

Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "local"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

terramate: Executing command "terraform plan"

## Add Terraform resources

In this section, we create a Terraform [Null Resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/null/latest/docs/resources/resource.html)
for the purpose of demonstration. Null Resources do not need to configure any cloud credentials as they do not create real
resources but only virtual ones.

This example will show:
- You can use plain Terraform config in any stack and do not need to use Terramate‚Äôs [Code Generation](../code-generation/index.md).
- Running only on changed stacks can save us time running and reviewing.

```sh
cat <<EOF >stacks/second/null.tf
resource "null_resource" "quickstart" {
}
EOF

git add stacks/second/null.tf
git commit -m "Add a null resource"
```

Applying the changes will need a sequence of re-initializing Terraform, and running `terraform apply` in the changed stacks.
As we only added the resource to the `second` stack, we can leverage Terramate‚Äôs [Change Detection](../change-detection/index.md)
to run in the changed stack only too.

Running commands in stacks containing changes only, allows us to keep execution run times fast and blast radius small.

Re-initialize Terraform to download the null provider:

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate run --changed terraform init
```

``` [output]
terramate: Entering stack in /stacks/second
terramate: Executing command "terraform init"

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/null...
- Installing hashicorp/null v3.2.2...
- Installed hashicorp/null v3.2.2 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Preview a plan:

::: code-group
```sh [shell]

``` [output]
terramate: Entering stack in /stacks/second
terramate: Executing command "terraform plan"

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # null_resource.quickstart will be created

      + id = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
```

After reviewing the plan, we can apply the changes:

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate run --changed terraform apply -auto-approve
```

``` [output]
terramate: Entering stack in /stacks/second
terramate: Executing command "terraform apply -auto-approve"

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # null_resource.quickstart will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "quickstart" {
      + id = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
null_resource.quickstart: Creating...
null_resource.quickstart: Creation complete after 0s [id=6372471593458417750]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```
:::

When running `terraform plan` again, we expect no changes to be planned anymore:

::: code-group
```sh [shell]
terramate run --changed terraform plan
```

``` [output]
terramate: Entering stack in /stacks/second
terramate: Executing command "terraform plan"
null_resource.quickstart: Refreshing state... [id=6372471593458417750]

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

## Conclusion

We hope this tutorial has helped you grasp the basics of Terramate.
Here's a summary of what we learned:

- How to initialize a Terramate Repository with Git support
- How to create [Terramate Stacks](../stacks/index.md)
- How to leverage [Change Detection](../change-detection/index.md) when [managing stacks](../stacks/manage.md) or [running commands](../orchestration/run-commands-in-stacks.md)
- How to [generate code](../code-generation/index.md) (Terraform Backend) in all stacks to keep the configuration DRY
- How to deploy Terraform using a local backend and [null resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/null/latest/docs/resources/resource.html) as an example
- Terramate is not limited to executing Terraform, but can help scale Terraform for any use case

Those examples hopefully give you a starting point and help you get insights into the capabilities of Terramate.
This is just the tip of the iceberg and running code generation and change detection on scale can help you save a lot of time when maintaining or running Terraform.
