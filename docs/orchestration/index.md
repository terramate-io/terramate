# Stacks Execution Orchestration

The orchestration of stack's execution is driven by the `terramate run` command
and it supports different ways of selecting stacks and configuring the order of
execution.

## Stacks selection

The **selection** defines which stacks from the whole set must be selected to
execute and terramate provides three ways of configuring that:

1. Change detection

The [change detection](../change-detection/index.md) filter out stacks not changed.

2. Current directory

Terramate uses the current directory it is being executed to filter out stacks, ie., limit the scope
of the execution, so if you execute `terramate` from the project's root
directory, all stacks will be selected, and changing to inner directories in the
project structure will select only stacks that are children of the current directory.

3. Explicit `wants` relationship.

The `wants` attribute of the stack block defines an explicit relationship
between a stack and its list of wanted stacks, that when provided it says
that when a stack is selected all the stacks listed on its `wants` list will also be
selected, always, independent of any other selection criteria.

Example:

```hcl
stack {
    wants = [
        "/other/stack1",
        "/other/stack2"
    ]
}
```

These 3 selection methods could be used together, and the order which they are
applied is: `change detection`, `current directory`, `wants`.

## Stacks ordering

Sometimes stacks are completely independent of each other, but on
certain occasions it may happen that infrastructure that is created
by **stack-a** is required by **stack-b**, like using the outputs
of **stack-a** as inputs for **stack-b**.

This can be done through data sources or
by [loading the state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/remote-state-data.html)
of another stack, or even an implicit dependency like hard coding the name/ID.

Independent on how you approach the problem, you need
an explicit way to communicate that changes on **stack A** affects execution of
**stack B**, so the order of execution of the stacks, if they are
selected for execution, should always be:

* 1 - **stack A**
* 2 - **stack B**

To help with that terramate provides two ways to define the desired order of
execution between stacks.

### Filesystem hierarchical order

Creating an hierarchy of stacks in the filesystem will make Terramate execute
parent stacks before their children.

This is a double-edged sword because it allows you to move stacks around to
better resemble the cloud infrastructure and the order of which things must
be executed with zero code change but in counterpart beware that moving stacks
just for cosmetic purposes can potentially change the execution order and break things.

### Explicit Order Of Execution

Order of execution can be explicitly declared inside the **stack** block using
the fields **before** and **after**.

Each field is a set of string (**set(string)**), where each string is a path that
references another directory, which can be a stack or contain stacks inside.

The explicit order can be used in conjunction with the implicit filesystem order
but have in mind that a parent stack in the filesystem can never execute after a
child one, and trying to make this using explicit **before** and **after** clauses
will lead to a cycle error.

References to directories can be relative to the stack being configured in the form:

```
../../dir
```

Or they can be relative to the project root, starting with "/":

```
/path/relative/to/project/root/dir
```

**before** ensures that the configured stack is executed before the
stacks contained in the directory paths. As the stack you are saying:
"I execute before all stacks inside these directories".

**after** ensures the opposite, that the stacks contained in the provided
directories are executed before the current stack. As the stack, you are saying:
"I execute after all stacks inside these directories".

For example, let's assume we have a project organized like this:

```
.
├── stack-a
│   └── terramate.tm.hcl
└── stack-b
    └── terramate.tm.hcl
```

And **stack-a/terramate.tm.hcl** looks like:


```hcl
stack {}
```


And then we have **stack-b/terramate.tm.hcl**:


```hcl
stack {
    after = [
        "../stack-a"
    ]
}
```

That can also be defined by using a project root relative path:


```hcl
stack {
    after = [
        "/stack-a"
    ]
}
```

For both equivalent configurations, the order of execution will be:

* stack-a
* stack-b

The same order of execution can be defined using **before**:

**stack-a/terramate.tm.hcl**:

```hcl
stack {
    before = [
        "../stack-b"
    ]
}
```

**stack-b/terramate.tm.hcl**:

```hcl
stack {}
```

This would also be a valid way to express the same order (although redundant):

**stack-a/terramate.tm.hcl**:

```hcl
stack {
    before = [
        "../stack-b"
    ]
}
```

**stack-b/terramate.tm.hcl**:

```hcl
stack {
    after = [
        "../stack-a"
    ]
}
```

You can also use **before** and **after** simultaneously on the same
stack for more complex scenarios. Lets add a third **stack-c** to our example.
The three stacks are defined as follows:

**stack-a/terramate.tm.hcl**:

```hcl
stack {}
```

**stack-b/terramate.tm.hcl**:

```hcl
stack {}
```

**stack-c/terramate.tm.hcl**:

```hcl
stack {
    before = [
        "../stack-b"
    ]
    after = [
        "../stack-a"
    ]
}
```

The order of execution will be:

* stack-a
* stack-c
* stack-b

One example of terramate command that leverages order of
execution is **terramate run**.

This will run **terraform** plan on all stacks, but respecting ordering:

```sh
terramate run terraform plan
```

### Change Detection And Ordering

When using any terramate command with support to change detection,
execution order is only imposed on stacks detected as changed. If a stack
is mentioned on **before**/**after** but the mentioned stack has no changes
on it, it will be ignored when calculating order.

An example of such a command would be using terramate to run **terraform apply**,
but only on changes stacks, like this:

```bash
terramate run --changed terraform apply
```

The overall algorithm for this case:

* Check which stacks have changed, lets call the result a **changeset**
* Ordering is established on top of the previously calculated **changeset**

Given that we have 3 stacks, **stack-a**, **stack-b**, **stack-c**.
**stack-a** has no ordering requisites.
**stack-b** defines this order:

```hcl
stack {
    after = [
        "../stack-a",
    ]
}
```

**stack-c** defines this order:

```hcl
stack {
    after = [
        "../stack-a",
        "../stack-b",
    ]
}
```

The **static** order is defined as:

* stack-a
* stack-b
* stack-c

If the **changeset=('stack-a', 'stack-c')**, this will be the **runtime** order:

* stack-a
* stack-c

Even though **stack-c** defined that it needs to be run after **stack-b**, since
**stack-b** has no changes on it, it will be ignored when defining the
**runtime** order.


## Stack Execution Environment

It is possible to control the environment variables of commands when they are
executed on a stack. That is done through the `terramate.config.run.env` block.
More details on how to use can be find [Project Configuration](../configuration/project-config.md#terramateconfigrunenv)
documentation.


## Failure Modes

Currently the behavior when a stack execution fails given a total order of
execution is undefined. Whatever observed behavior should not be relied upon
since it may change on the future.


### What About Cycles/Conflicts ?

If any cycles are detected on the ordering definitions this will be
considered a failure and **terramate** will abort with an
error message pointing out the detected cycle.

Also in the case of a conflict, like a stack defined like this:

**stack-a/terramate.tm.hcl**:

```hcl
stack {
    before = [
        "../stack-b"
    ]
    after = [
        "../stack-b"
    ]
}
```

An error will be reported.
